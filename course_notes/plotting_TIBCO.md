## 05. Interpreting Bar Chart Visualizations

Two types of bar charts:
1. compare **aggregate measures of a group** of values (categorical data + aggregate measure)
2. examine **data distribution** (continuous data or binned + count)

**Aggregate charts** - useful for making comparisons or examining patterns or trends.  
For example: Which department displays the highest total amount of purchases?

**Distribution charts** - bar chart may be configured like a histogram, in order to examine data  
distribution, by displaying bar heights as a **count of values**.  
**Binned data** - gathering data into groups based upon data ranges.  
For example: bin (group) customers ages into twelve ranges and display a count for each bin by  
reflecting it in the height of the bars.  

Comparisons may be:
* absolute
* relative



## 14. Interpreting Heat Map Visualizations

**Heatmap** - color code representation of a data from two-dimensional list. 

Heatmap is like a table or cross table view - with only colors displayed.

In heatmaps the **color of the cells relates the value**.

Heatmap - is also a tool for **computational multivariate data analysis**.  

One of the valuable aspects of the heat map is the **ability to view large data tables in their entirety**,  
because color takes up less space than numbers.  

Because heat maps are all about color, you should consider the wide variety of color scheme options  
when interpreting heat map.  

The first consideration is the extent to which the color scheme is applied.  

Color scheme can be applied to each column independently or to entire heatmap.  

Defining segment color threshold points may be done by:
* colors based on fixed threshold 
* defining color by performing different calculations.  
* rules that applied to define color

**Dendrograms** - a more robust way to **organize the multiple continuous measures, or multivariate data**.  
With it, we can sort the rows and columns of the heat map.  
The algorithm which generates dendrograms, known as **hierarchical clustering**, affords many settings options.
