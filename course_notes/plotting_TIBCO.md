## 14. Interpreting Heat Map Visualizations

**Heatmap** - color code representation of a data from two-dimentional list. 

Heatmap is like a table or cross table view - with only colors displayed.

In heatmaps the **color of the cells relates the value**.

Heatmap - is also tool for **computational multivariate data analysis**.  

One of the valuable aspects of the heat map is the **ability to view large data tables in their entirety**,  
because color takes up less space than numbers.  

Because heat maps are all about color, you should consider the wide variety of color sheme options  
when interpreting heat map.  

The first consideration is the extent to which the color scheme is applied.  

Color scheme can be applied to each column independently or to entire heatmap.  

Defining segment color threshold points may be done by:
* colors based on fixed threshold 
* defining color by performing different calculations.  
* rules that applied to define color

**Dendrograms** - a more robust way to **organize the multiple continuous measures, or multivariate data**.  
With it we can sort the rows and columns of the heat map.  
The algorithm which generates dendrograms, known as **hierarchical clustering**, affords many different settings options.
